PURPOSE OF PROJECT:
VERSION or DATE: 4/30/2018
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: Right click on the "Driver" 
                           class and then run the main method.
                           
AUTHORS: Brianna Davis, Zach Giannuzzi, Abdul Samad, 
         Eric Sauer, Daniel Senecal
                       
USER INSTRUCTIONS: After running the main method, 
                   a window will pop-up allowing you 
                   to select which level to play. 
                   There are two difficulties to choose 
                   from: beginner and intermediate.

The objective of the game is to create a layout of the board so that 
the laser hits the target piece. There are certain pieces that may 
be moved and certain pieces that will remain stationary. For each 
level there is only one solution to the board so if you reach the 
goal you still may not win. To activate the laser you may press down 
on the red laser block or you can press on the red fire button. 
You must hold down on either the laser block or the fire button for 
the laser to be shown. You may left click on the rotatable laser maze 
pieces to rotate them. You can right click on movable pieces and then 
right click in a valid matrix space to move the piece to that specific 
space. To move the movable pieces, you may also click and hold to drag 
the pieces into a valid space. If your mouse is not in a valid space 
or range when you try and move a movable piece, the piece will go 
back to the side bar where it was originally located. The side bar to 
the right of the laser maze matrix is where your movable pieces 
originally are located. The pieces that can be rotated originally 
have "rotation arrows" on them. To view additional instructions on how 
to play laser maze, you may click on the small purple question mark box 
on the lower right hand side of the window just above the fire button. 
To get rid of the instructions, click on the small purple question mark 
box again. When you complete a level there is a pop-up window that gives 
you the options to play the beginner level, the intermediate level, or 
quit the application. Please do not use the red x button on the upper 
right of this pop-up window to exit the program, use the Quit button 
instead.

Thanks and Enjoy!
